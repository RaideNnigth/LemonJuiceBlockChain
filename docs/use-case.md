# Use Case Study for BlockChain

## 1 - Introduction

Blockchain is a tecnology that is being used in many areas, such as: finance, health, education, etc. In this case study, we will use blockchain to create a system that will be used to operate under a University environment. The system will deal with transactions such as student paying money to eat at University's restaurant, student paying a debt to the University library, student paying for a public transportation ticket given by University. The system will also deal with transactions such as University paying students scholarship.

We will create our own simple blockchain and crypto currence, with contracts.
